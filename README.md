# Introduction
This is smart bot. A "sentient" bot made using GPT-3. 

I orginally made this for Ohm Interactive server, but I have now open sourced it!

# How to run.
First install node (you probably already have it).
Then run npm install in the directory you put this bot in.

Make a file called .env and put your discord bot token and open ai key in there.

Format:

DISCORD_TOKEN=(your token)

OPENAI_API_KEY=(openai key)

# Conclusion
Well hope you enjoyed, that's it. Have fun with the bot!
